The JSON API provides an easily parseable interface to GGn. This can be useful for scripts and other tools. Below is the list of information available, the arguments that can be passed to each API, the format of the results, and an extended explanation on the results. This is a modified version of the Gazelle API and may not contain all of the same endpoints as other Gazelle sites. If there is an API missing that you would like to see added, post about it here to let us know!

Using the API bestows upon you a certain level of trust and responsibility. Abusing or using this API for malicious purposes is a bannable offense and will not be taken lightly.

Refrain from making more than five (5) requests every ten (10) seconds.

You can view your API usage history here. It will show the first access time for an endpoint by a given key from a given IP. If you do not recognize an entry, report it to staff ASAP.


Authentication

To use the API, you must have an API key.
To obtain API keys, go to your profile settings and scroll down to the API Keys section near the bottom, fill in a key name, select any permissions the key will need for your task at hand, and hit Save Profile. Your API key will be displayed at the top of the page one time. API keys are not visible anywhere and staff are not able to retrieve them if lost. You will have to delete and recreate the API key if you lose it.


Endpoint Permissions

Each API key can be assigned permissions which determine what endpoints that key has access to. Permissions are not needed for API endpoints that return the same results independent of the API key used, such as the search endpoint. Endpoints like the item equip endpoint and the userlog endpoint require the permission(s) noted within their entry.


Outline

All request URLs are in the form: api.php?request=<ACTION>

API keys are to be sent via an X-API-Key header on the HTTP request.

All the JSON returned is in the form:

{
  "status" : "success",
  "response" : {
    // Response data.
  }
}



If the request is invalid, or a problem occurs, the status will be failure. In this case the value of response is undefined. The HTTP response code will also reflect any errors occurred with your request.


Index

URL: api.php

Arguments: None

Permissions: None

Response format:
When sending no request the API will return the current version of the API. This can be parsed by scripts needing to ensure the availability of the new/updated endpoints. This version number will be incremented as future changes are made. We are using semvar versioning and will increment the patch version (last digit) when backwards compatible modifications are made to existing endpoints, the minor version (2nd digit) when new endpoints are added, and the major version (1st digit) when we make breaking API changes.
